## MERN App

This fullstack app allows new users to communicate and share details of their dog.  Upon signup, the user's information is captured in MySQL database.  The front end creates,updates and pulls data to and from the API.  

### Installing

The app uses several npm packages. To install these packages, navigate to the project folder and type:

yarn install

Make a .gitignore file and add the following lines to it. This will tell git not to track these files, and thus they won't be committed to Github.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
